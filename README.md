📊 Unearthing Insights from COVID-19 Data: A Data-Driven Exploration
In the face of the unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic, understanding the data has been paramount. I'm excited to share a project I've recently wrapped up, where I utilized SQL and Excel to conduct a comprehensive analysis of COVID-19 statistics.

🔍 Project Overview:
Over the past , I delved into a vast dataset encompassing COVID-19 statistics. By leveraging SQL for data extraction and Excel for thorough cleaning and exploration, I uncovered valuable insights that shed light on key trends .This article will analyze the covid data from all over the world from 1st Jan 2020 to 31st Apr 2021 to dig some meaningful insights using SQL.

📂 Data Collection:
The data for Analysis has been downloaded from OurWorldInData, but since it is 2022 the data would be quite different from the one I used in this article.

💡 Key Findings:
- Mexico has the highest death ratio of almost 10%.
- Syria, Sudan, Egypt and China are among the top 10 countries with the highest death ratio per total cases.
- India has a death ratio of 1.1%, lower than a few of its neighbouring countries like China, Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh.
- United States, Israel, France and Sweden are among the top 20 countries that have the highest infection ratio.
- On 24th Feb 2020, the highest death percentage of 28% was recorded.
- On 29th jan 2020, the lowest death percentage of 0.34% was recorded.
- Asia has the highest numbers of vaccinations achieved followed by North America and South America.
